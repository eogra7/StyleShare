# StyleShare

MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
An App is to be created that allows FBLA members to interact and share their opinions on style, fashion, and attire.
Users can snap a picture with their phone. They can share what they want to knowâ€”things like (a) Is this outfit stylish?, (b) Is this outfit professional?, (c)
Is this outfit within the FBLA-PBL dress code?, (d) What should I change to make this outfit better?, and other important details.
It should allow users to post outfits and interact with anyone else who has posted outfits.


NYS FBLA 2016 Mobile Application Development submission from Williamsville East High School
Group Members: Evan Ogra, Nikhil Gupta, Aniruddha Nrusimha

Project made in Android Studio 1.5.1

Instructions for testing:
Install the .apk files on an Android device running 5.0 (API Level 21), an emulator works great.

If there is any issue in getting the app to run, please contact me at eogra99@gmail.com
